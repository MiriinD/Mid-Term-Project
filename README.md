### Mid-Term project:  Airbnb Earnings Prediction Project

#### Overview
The Airbnb Earnings Prediction project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts the potential earnings of individuals opening an Airbnb property in Mexico City.

#### Data
The project utilizes a diverse dataset containing information related to Airbnb properties in Mexico City downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset includes attributes such as property features, neighborhood, historical earnings, host characteristics, and other relevant factors.

#### Goals
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the potential earnings of an Airbnb property in Mexico City. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques, the intention is to develop a reliable tool that assists prospective hosts in estimating their potential earnings and optimizing their property listings.

#### Methodology
The project encompasses various phases, including data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and model evaluation. Emphasis is placed on selecting appropriate features, developing robust models, and employing linear regression analysis to predict earnings.

#### Usage
The project's findings and the resulting predictive model are intended to provide valuable insights for prospective Airbnb hosts in Mexico City. The documentation and insights derived from the project will be made accessible to stakeholders seeking to understand the earnings potential of Airbnb properties in 16 neighborhoods.

#### Contributing
Collaboration and contributions aimed at enhancing the model's accuracy and extending its capabilities are welcome. Insights, feature suggestions, and model optimization contributions are encouraged to enrich the predictive capabilities of the model.
