# Mid-Term-Project
Lung Cancer Prediction Analysis

## Overview

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, responsible for approximately 1.59 million deaths in 2018. The majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking.

This analysis aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing lung cancer based on various factors with the use of basic machine learning tools.

## Data

The analysis utilizes a dataset containing lifestyle, and medical information of individuals, with a focus on identifying patterns and risk factors associated with the development of lung cancer.

## Goals

The primary goal of this analysis is to build a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals at risk of developing lung cancer. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the intention is to create a tool that can aid in early detection and intervention efforts.

## Usage

To replicate or build upon this analysis, the dataset used and the methodology employed is provided in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook. Users can contribute to the further development and refinement of the predictive model.

## Contributing

Collaboration and contributions to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictive model are encouraged.
