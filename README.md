### Mid-Term project:  Airbnb Earnings Prediction Project

#### Overview
The Airbnb Earnings Prediction project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts the potential earnings of individuals opening an Airbnb property in Mexico City.

#### Data
The project utilizes a diverse dataset containing information related to Airbnb properties in Mexico City downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset includes attributes such as property features, neighborhood, historical earnings, host characteristics, and other relevant factors.

#### Goals
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the potential earnings of an Airbnb property in Mexico City. By leveraging various machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques, the intention is to develop a reliable tool that assists prospective hosts in estimating their potential earnings and optimizing their property listings.

#### Methodology
The project encompasses various phases, including data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and model evaluation. Emphasis is placed on selecting appropriate features, developing robust models, and employing linear regression analysis to predict earnings.

#### Usage
The project's findings and the resulting predictive model are intended to provide valuable insights for prospective Airbnb hosts in Mexico City. The documentation and insights derived from the project will be made accessible to stakeholders seeking to understand the earnings potential of Airbnb properties in 16 neighborhoods.

#### Contributing
Collaboration and contributions aimed at enhancing the model's accuracy and extending its capabilities are welcome. Insights, feature suggestions, and model optimization contributions are encouraged to enrich the predictive capabilities of the model.



# Mid-Term-Project
Lung Cancer Prediction Analysis

## Overview

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, responsible for approximately 1.59 million deaths in 2018. The majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking.

This analysis aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing lung cancer based on various factors with the use of basic machine learning tools.

## Data

The analysis utilizes a dataset containing lifestyle, and medical information of individuals, with a focus on identifying patterns and risk factors associated with the development of lung cancer.

## Goals

The primary goal of this analysis is to build a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals at risk of developing lung cancer. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the intention is to create a tool that can aid in early detection and intervention efforts.

## Usage

To replicate or build upon this analysis, the dataset used and the methodology employed is provided in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook. Users can contribute to the further development and refinement of the predictive model.

## Contributing

Collaboration and contributions to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictive model are encouraged.
